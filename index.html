<h2>Part 0.0: Calibrating My Camera and Capturing a 3D Scan</h2>

<h2>Part 0.1: Calibrating My Camera</h2>

<p>
    Following the assignment instructions, I first captured a set of calibration images
    containing multiple ArUco markers. I printed the calibration tag sheet and took
    around 40 images using my phone camera, keeping the zoom fixed while varying the
    viewing angle and distance. Phone cameras work well for this task since their images
    are already mostly undistorted.
</p>

<p>
    In my calibration script, I looped through all captured images and used OpenCV’s
    ArUco detector to locate the markers. For each detected tag, I extracted the 2D
    corner coordinates. Since the real-world physical size of each tag is known, I
    defined the 3D corner points accordingly (e.g., a 2cm × 2cm square mapped to
    four 3D points lying on the z=0 plane).
</p>

<p>
    After collecting all 2D–3D correspondences from all images, I used
    <code>cv2.calibrateCamera()</code> to estimate my camera intrinsics and distortion
    coefficients. These calibration parameters will later be used to compute object
    pose for the 3D scan.
